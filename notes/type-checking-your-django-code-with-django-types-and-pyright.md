## Type checking your Django code with django-types and Pyright
### by Kyle Bebak
---

- Python type hints
  - added in py3.5
  - newer libs built with types
  - older libs like Django, types added as stubs
    - stubs are files separate from code
    - don't have to be bundled with library
    - nice because they can be maintained separately
  - using type hints is a tradeoff
    - more work upfront
    - helps correctness, documentation, IDE features, etc
- Django type hints
  - doesn't have inline type hints in source code
    - they are a barrier for new contributors
    - "type stubs" libs maintained by community
    - some things are difficult to type hint
  - Django type hint libraries:
    - [django-stubs](https://github.com/typeddjango/django-stubs)
    - [django-types](https://github.com/sbdchd/django-types)
      - is a fork of django-stubs
  - Type checkers
    - mypy (maintained by Dropbox)
    - pyright (Microsoft)
    - pyre (Facebook)
    - pytype (Google)
  - Which type checker should you use?
    - pyright is not only type checker but also a language server
      - LSP (Language Server)
      - quality of codebase and tool is really good!
    - can be used with django-types
    - django-stubs is mypy only
      - syntax not compatible with standard plugins
      - django-types is fork of django-stubs with mypy stuff removed
- Type hints requirement
  - Install type stubs
    - [django-types](https://github.com/sbdchd/django-types), [djangorestframework-types](https://github.com/sbdchd/djangorestframework-types)
  - Install pyright
    - enable in text editor
    - configure `pyrightconfig.json`
    - point to correct virtualenv
  - Python 3.8+ has better type hint syntax
    - `from __future__ import annotations` to use higher version syntax
    - `list` instead of `List`, `|` for unions, etc
- Code demo
  - `pyrightconfig.json` has a bunch of configurations
  - going to add types to an existing project
